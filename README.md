In this repository I will work in the first assessment of module 1, which is about Python.
A file with the exercise to be solved was provided. To do this, I need to create a class called 'TiendaOnline' and in each statement ask for a method for this class.
I'm doing this exercise in the follow way: I first created the functions in a Jupyter notebook to see if it works and then I'll create these functions as methods of the class.
